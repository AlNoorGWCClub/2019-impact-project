    "The last time I thought about taking heroin was yesterday. I had received "an inconvenient truth" from a beautiful woman. It wasn't about climate change – I'm not that ecologically switched on – she told me she was pregnant and it wasn't mine.
I had to take immediate action."

    "When I was eight years old, I was sexually harassed by my own brother who I still live with today. I was harassed multiple times, but I didn’t have the courage to tell anybody about it. Amongst his friends and family he was a respected man, but inside him lived a monster that I only knew of. He continued to harass me for two years; not even our parents noticed that there was something wrong. Living in a conservative desi society I was not allowed to talk, give my opinion, or even hint out, about how I was feeling. 
Nobody noticed the naughty girl was missing in family gatherings."
